# Tamuyal
Tamuyal is a location-based, mobile, educational game for increasing K-12 students' interest in STEM fields.

Tamuyal, presents a new approach to increase K-12 students' awareness of higher education in STEM by showcasing some of the majors, including non-STEM majors to cater to more students, while touring our campus. The game, in its current form, covers fun STEM facts, facts specific to UCSB, and facts about jobs related to some STEM careers. Our product is meant to be fun, inspiring, motivating, and educational. We hope to accomplish this by combining information about majors on campus, physical exploration, local animal and plant species, and a Mayan theme for cultural relevance to minority students. In the future, we hope to add specifics about the college application process, college life, more related STEM careers, and what a day in a related job may be like.
